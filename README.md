## Usage

Firstly, a user needs to sign up or login in into the app. They then will be taken to the homescreen where they will be able to select whether they want to make a flashcard set or quiz, upload their notes, change the settings pertaining to what they are creating and create the flashcard or quiz. From there, the user will be taken to the homepage for that flashcard or quiz. For the flashcards, the home page gives the user the ability to add new cards, edit cards, or start practicing a certain number of flashcards. The user can practice the flashcards as much as they would like at any time since the user can reaccess their flashcards in the history page. For the quiz, the home includes basic information about the quiz and a button for the user to start the quiz. The user can then complete the quiz. Afterwards, they will be able to see their results and can click another button to see all the questions again. The user can then retake the quiz as much as they would like to. 

## Future Improvements
